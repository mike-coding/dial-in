## 📋 Component Architecture

### Current Components
- **App.tsx** - Main application container

- **Tasks.tsx** - Task list container
- **Task.tsx** - Individual task card
- **TaskDetails.tsx** - Expandable task editor
- **MobileNavigation.tsx** - Bottom navigation
- **Drawer.tsx** - Desktop sidebar

### Component Design Patterns
1. **Container/Presenter** - Logic containers with dumb display components
2. **Compound components** - Related components that work together
3. **Render props** - For flexible component composition
4. **Custom hooks** - For shared logic and state management

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### User Experience Goals
- **Task creation** should take < 5 seconds
- **Task completion** should be one-tap on mobile
- **Navigation** should be intuitive without instruction
- **Loading states** should be under 200ms perception

### Technical Goals
- **Mobile performance** - 60fps animations
- **Bundle size** - Keep under 500KB gzipped
- **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Test coverage** - 80%+ for critical paths

---

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript strict mode** - No any types
- **Consistent naming** - PascalCase components, camelCase functions
- **Component props** - Destructured with TypeScript interfaces
- **Error handling** - Graceful degradation with user feedback
