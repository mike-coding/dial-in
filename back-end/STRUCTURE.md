# Backend File Structure

The backend has been successfully decomposed into a modular architecture:

## File Organization

### Core Files
- `app.py` - Main FastAPI application with route registration
- `database.py` - Database configuration and session management
- `models.py` - SQLAlchemy database models
- `schemas.py` - Pydantic models for request/response validation

### Routes Module (`routes/`)
- `__init__.py` - Package initialization
- `auth.py` - Authentication endpoints (login, register)
- `categories.py` - Category CRUD operations
- `tasks.py` - Task CRUD operations and completion tracking
- `events.py` - Event CRUD operations
- `rules.py` - Rule CRUD operations
- `user_data.py` - Basic user information

## Database Models

### User Management
- `User` - User accounts with authentication

### Content Models
- `Category` - Organizational categories for tasks/events
- `Rule` - Automation rules with rate patterns
- `Task` - Individual tasks with completion tracking
- `Event` - Scheduled events with time ranges

## API Structure

All endpoints are organized under logical prefixes:
- `/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints
- `/categories/*` - Category management
- `/tasks/*` - Task management
- `/events/*` - Event management
- `/rules/*` - Rule management
- `/user-data/*` - User data operations

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Each file has a single responsibility
2. **Maintainability** - Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
3. **Scalability** - New features can be added as separate modules
4. **Testing** - Individual modules can be tested in isolation
5. **Code Reuse** - Models and schemas are shared across routes

## Database Schema

The database includes proper relationships:
- Categories belong to Users (N:1)
- Rules belong to Categories (N:1)
- Tasks belong to Users and Categories, optionally Rules (N:1)
- Events belong to Users and Categories, optionally Rules (N:1)

All models include proper timestamps and the ability to serialize to dictionaries for API responses.
